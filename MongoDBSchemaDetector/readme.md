# Sample payload to trigger lambda from Visual Studio

Make sure that `awsRegion`, `s3.bucket.name`, `s3.object.key`, `s3.bucket.arn` have correct values - do not use values generated by the aws toolkit.

# Important things to show

* Do not use recursive invocation. Input and output buckets should be different. Writing to the same bucket increases the risk of creating a recursive invocation.

![001-s3-trigger-ack-recursive.png](./images/001-s3-trigger-ack-recursive.png)

* Handling exceptions - by default it retries two more times, with a one-minute wait between second and third attempt.
  TODO - add links to docs about it. Dead-letter queue.

* Control access to s3 buckets on IAM role level (this would be infrastructure code).

* Share how I will cleanup

* Use tags (owner) to point the owner

* Can read logs from lambda in aws toolkit

* Query in json file is not a json string!

* All examples are in kind of json: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/type/

* IAM role used by lambda

* 3 new network interfaces has been created with type lambda

* Create VPC endpoint (only then lambda which is in a VPC can access S3)

* Run command was working locally without problems, problems were in Atlas

# Lambda permissions

The following policies must be assigned to the IAM role `InnovationSprintMongoSchemaDetectorRole` used by the lambda.

* `AmazonVPCCrossAccountNetworkInterfaceOperations` (maybe enough would be inline policy with `ec2:CreateNetworkInterface`).
* `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` - it gives access to the `CloudWatch`.
* Inline policy for accessing selected keys from the `SecretsManager`
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowReadStorageSecrets",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "secretsmanager:ListSecretVersionIds",
                "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
                "secretsmanager:GetResourcePolicy",
                "secretsmanager:DescribeSecret"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:[999999999999]:secret:/test_platform/storage/username-[11111]",
                "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:[999999999999]:secret:/test_platform/storage/password-[222222]"
            ]
        }
    ]
  }
  ```
* Inline policy for accessing selected `S3` buckets.
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::innovation-sprint-mongodb-schema-detector/*"
        }
    ]
  }
  ```

# Lambda networking

In case lambda has to connect to a database via its dedicated `VPC endpoint` the lambda has to be added to this `VPC` with additional configuration.

* Create security group `InnovationSprintSecurityGroupMongoSchemaDetector` which accept all traffic (could be more strict to improve security).

* Add lambda to the `VPC` and assign the same subnets (usually it will be **private subnets**) which are attached to the database `VPC endpoint`. Also select created security group `InnovationSprintSecurityGroupMongoSchemaDetector` during assigning lambda to the `VPC`.

* In inbound rules of the security group used in the DB `VPC endpoint` add entry which allows on traffic if the source is `InnovationSprintSecurityGroupMongoSchemaDetector`. Thanks to this lambda will get access to the DB `VPC endpoint`. Another option is to assign another security group to the DB `VPC endpoint` which would allow on such traffic.

* During assigning lambda to the VPC 3 new network interfaces will be created with `interface type` set on `Lambda`. This interfaces are used in communication between lambda and other recourses in the VPC.

**Because our lambda is now in the `VPC` it cannot talk to `S3` and `SecretsManager`. Additional configuration is required.**

* Create VPC endpoint `InnovationSprintMongoSchemaDetectorS3` for accessing S3 by the lambda. Select route table which has routes for the subnets selected in earlier steps (usually it will be **private subnets**).

* Create VPC endpoint `InnovationSprintMongoSchemaDetectorSecrets` for accessing `Secrets Manager` by the lambda. Select the same subnets which are assigned to the lambda and assign security group `InnovationSprintSecurityGroupMongoSchemaDetector` (this security group configuration could be more strict).

Now our lambda should have access to all needed resources: `S3`, `Secrets Manager` and database via 3 different `VPC endpoints`.

>NOTE: **When a lambda is not assign to a VPC then it can talk to other AWS services like `S3` and `SecretsManager` and creating mentioned endpoints is not needed.**

## IaC

* Used workspace

```
PS D:\GitHub\kicaj29\MongoDB\MongoDBSchemaDetector\terraform\iac> terraform workspace new demo1-lambda
Created and switched to workspace "demo1-lambda"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.
```

## Destroying selected resources

```
terraform destroy -target="aws_s3_bucket_object.bucket-input"
```
